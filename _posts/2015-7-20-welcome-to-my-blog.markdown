#Hey, howdy, hello.

I've decided to use Jekyll to get a personal site up and running.

##Why?

I bought akhilcacharya.me earlier this year, I feel like I might as well put it to use. That and hosting is expensive.

##So...what's this for?

I'll probably use this space to elaborate on the ideas that I'm either thinking about or building. I may cross-post releases of projects here as well.

So let's get to it!
