I spend a considerable amount of my free time hacking away at various personal projects. Here's a list of a handful I've worked on over the past few years.


##[Downcount](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.akhilcacharya.down&hl=en)
Designed and built a super simple countdown application for Android. Achieved recognition on TheNextWeb, Lifehacker, and the British edition of Gizmodo (it counts!) Over 21,000 downloads so far.

Utilizes Neodatis ODB for persistence and Google Play In-App Billing SDK.

##[Melanorml](https://bitbucket.org/akhilcacharya/melanorml-for-android)
Wrote an Android app for rapid early detection of Melanoma using the Metamind API. Built for the final creative project of Honors 310 at NCSU, it was voted the best project of the semester.  

##[SVSMKinect](https://github.com/akhilcacharya/SVSMKinect)
Developed a Kinect application to behave as an intermediary between an off-the shelf first generation Kinect Sensor and an infrared transmitter. Using the open source software package WinLIRC, the Kinect can be used to control remote IR devices.

Written in C# using the Kinect SDK.

##And more!
More projects can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/akhilcacharya) and on my [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.com/akhilcacharya).
